# References in the Learning TypeScript Book

Finding the right names and values for small code snippets is a surprisingly challenging task.
Sample content like [foo bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar) and [lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) gets boring quickly -- and can be confusing to readers who aren't yet familiar with them.
It's better to have self-contained code snippets that can be clearly understood without any external context.

Crafting appropriate themed content that fits cleanly with the theory being demonstrated is fraught with danger.
Code snippets shouldn't contain an egregious quantity of tangentially-related setup code just to justify their theme.
Themes also shouldn't be unnecessarily flashy to the point of distracting from the important conceptual explanations.

Many authors opt to stick with a small set of themes they know to be flexible and work well.
I personally go with names of fruit, such as counting amounts of them.
While sticking with the same theme repeatedly is reliable, it can get boring for the reader fast.

That's why, at risk of distracting ever so slightly from code content, most chapters in _Learning TypeScript_ use an overarching theme for most or all of its code snippets.
Most of the themes are fairly straightforward, such as historical authors or inventors.
Others are a little more subtle and act more like [easter eggs](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)>).

## Criteria for Inclusion

I also paid special attention to the gender and race makeup for people referenced in the book.
Most software textbooks are significantly skewed towards white men in their quotes.
Some don't include a single quote from any group underrepresented in tech!
_Learning TypeScript_ inverses that ratio: the vast majority of its references are to people who belong to groups underrepresented in the tech industry.

Most referenced people are not young (below retirement age).
I worry that someone who seems great at time of publishing may turn out to be a negative figure later on <small>(see: [Elizabeth Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes#Downfall); [J. K. Rowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling#Transgender_people))</small>.
Still, there are a few pre-retirement figures in whom I have high confidence and I couldn't resist including.
