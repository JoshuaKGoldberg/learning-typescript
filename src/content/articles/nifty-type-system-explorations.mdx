# Nifty Uses of TypeScript's Type System

[TypeScript's type system is Turing Complete](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14833): meaning it has conditional branching (conditional types) and works with an arbitrary huge amount of memory.
Most applications try to get away with as few conditional types as possible because they can become complex pretty quickly.
That's good advice mentioned in _Learning TypeScript_.

Some wild developers on the internet have instead leaned into th type system's capabilities by implementing shockingly complex logic in it.
This blog post is an ever-evolving list of clever applications of the type system.

## ðŸ›‘ Caveat: This Is Not Normal

Please don't look at the following projects list and think you need to be that familiar with TypeScript's type system.
These projects are ridiculous.
They're the equivalent of [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf): a fun activity for a select few, but not useful for day-to-day work for almost any.

## Projects List

All projects in this list include helpful explanations explaining how they work:

- \[November 2020\] [Number Arithmetic](https://itnext.io/implementing-arithmetic-within-typescripts-type-system-a1ef140a6f6f) _(Ryan Dabler)_
- \[October 2020\] [Tic Tac Toe](https://blog.joshuakgoldberg.com/type-system-game-engines) _(Josh Goldberg)_
- \[September 2020\] [SQL database engine](https://twitter.com/c_pick/status/1307433762914009090) _(Charles Pick)_
- \[February 2020\] [Maze Solver](https://twitter.com/ronenamiel/status/1232012684268392450) and [many more meta types](https://github.com/ronami/meta-typing) _(Ronen Amiel)_
- \[October 2019\] [Binary Arithmetic](https://blog.joshuakgoldberg.com/binary-arithmetic) _(Josh Goldberg)_

## More Resources

If the explanations in projects aren't working out for you, I have two resources I'd recommend:

- The _Learning TypeScript_ book covers the foundations of the type system up through smaller uses of conditional and inferred types
- [Zhenghao He](https://twitter.com/he_zhenghao)'s [An Introduction To Type Programming In TypeScript](https://www.zhenghao.io/posts/type-programming) is a gentle but comprehensive walkthrough

Additionally, [type-challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) contains a wonderful suite of type challenges starting with foundations and working up to gloriously complex metaprogramming.
I'd highly recommend using them to work your way up to being able to take on
