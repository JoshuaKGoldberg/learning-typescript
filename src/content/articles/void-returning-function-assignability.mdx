# `void` Returning Function Assignability

Most popular programming languages use the `void` keyword to indicate that a function cannot return a value.
_Learning TypeScript_ describes TypeScript's `void` keyword as indicating that the returned value from a function will be ignored.
Those two definitions are not always the same!
TypeScript's `void` comes with an initially surprising behavior: a function type with a non-`void` return is considered assignable to a function type with a `void` return.

```ts
let returnsVoid: () => void;

returnsVoid = () => "this is fine";
```

## `void` Is More of an Idea

```ts
["a", "b"].forEach((value) => console.log(value));
```

Note that TypeScript will not allow you to

```ts
function thisIsNotFine(): void {
  return "ðŸ”¥";
  // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'void'.
}
```
