# Why Looping Over Objects Is Hard To Type Safely

JavaScript allows for looping over all the keys and/or values in an object in a few different ways.
One commonly used way is with a `for..in` loop that loops over the keys of an object and looks each value under its key.
TypeScript often takes issue with that approach by treating the keys as `string` rather than a more narrow, specific type:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 7053
const values = { apple: 1, banana: 2 };

for (const key in values) {
  //       ^?
  console.log(key, values[key]);
}

// Logs:
// "apple", 1
// "banana", 2
```

Why does TypeScript give this complaint?
Can't it use a more precise key type such as `keyof typeof values` (`"apple" | "banana"`), to allow lookups like the `key[value]`?

TypeScript's type system intentionally won't, and for good (if inconvenient) reasons.
Let's dig in and see why!

{/* <!-- truncate --> */}

## Structural Typing and Excess Properties

TypeScript's type system is _structurally typed_: meaning any object that happens to match a type shape is allowed in locations marked as that type.
For example, the following `countFruits` function that takes in a `FruitsCount` shape allows any object that happens to match that shape:

```ts
interface FruitsCount {
  apple: number;
  banana: number;
}

function countFruits(counts: FruitsCount) {
  console.log("apple", counts.apple);
  console.log("banana", counts.banana);
}

const fruitsAndVegetable = {
  apple: 1,
  banana: 2,
  zucchini: "gotcha!",
};

countFruits(fruitsAndVegetable); // Ok
```

Notice how although the `fruitsAndVegetable` object had an extra `zucchini` property, it still was allowed as an argument to the `counts` parameter of type `FruitsCount`.
Structural typing means values don't need to be explicitly declared as adhering to any type.
If they happen to match a particular type's structure, they can be used in places of that type.

Unfortunately, the convenience of structural typing means there's often no guarantee that a value thought to be a particular type shape doesn't have additional, unknown properties.
Looping over the keys of an object therefore is not guaranteed to be only the known keys from its type.
The `fruitsAndVegetable` variable's additional `zucchini` property, for example, would show up in a `for..in` loop inside `countFruits`:

```ts twoslash
const fruitsAndVegetable = {
  apple: 1,
  banana: 2,
  zucchini: "gotcha!",
};
// ---cut---
function countFruits(counts: any) {
  for (const key in counts) {
    console.log(key, counts[key]);
  }
}

countFruits(fruitsAndVegetable);

// Logs:
// "apple", 1
// "banana", 2
// "zuccihini", "gotcha!"
```

That's why TypeScript considers the iterator variable in `for..in` loops (here, `key`) to be type `string`.
It often has no way of knowing whether a value contains excess properties not declared in its type.

Given TypeScript's structural typing nature, how can we safely loop over an object's keys and values?

## Option: Type Assertions

If you are 100% confident that an object won't contain excess keys, you can always use an `as` type assertion.
Type assertions tell TypeScript to treat a value as a different type than it would normally.
They're useful for situations where you know something TypeScript can't infer from code, such as knowing that a value will only ever be its exact declared type shape.

This code snippet uses an `as` type assertion to tell TypeScript to treat `key` as one of the keys of `values`:

```ts twoslash
const values = { apple: 1, banana: 2 };

for (const key in values) {
  console.log(key, values[key as keyof typeof values]); // Ok
}

// Logs:
// "apple", 1
// "banana", 2
```

If you don't want to change the structure of your code at all, type assertions are a handy way to quickly bend TypeScript to your will.

## Option: Static Object Methods

The global [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) class contains several helpers -[`Object.entries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries), [`Object.keys()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys), and [`Object.values()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Object/values)- that can create arrays of object keys and/or values:

```js
Object.entries(values); // [["apple", 1], ["banana", 2]]
Object.keys(values); // ["apple", "banana"]
Object.values(values); // [1, 2]
```

Using static `Object` methods can sometimes make it easier to work with type assertions.

`Object.keys` returns a `string[]`, which can then be looped over in a `for..of` loop.
This code snippet uses a type assertion so that `key` is always type `"apple" | "banana"`:

```ts twoslash
const values = { apple: 1, banana: 2 };

for (const key of Object.keys(values) as (keyof typeof values)[]) {
  console.log(key, values[key]); // Ok
}

// Logs:
// "apple", 1
// "banana", 2
```

Even better, `Object.entries` returns an array of `[key, value]` pairs that can be looped over directly:

```ts twoslash
// @lib: dom,esnext
const values = { apple: 1, banana: 2 };

for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(values)) {
  console.log(key, value); // Ok
}

// Logs:
// "apple", 1
// "banana", 2
```

Note how the type of `value` in the `Object.entries(values)` loop was `number`.
`Object.entries` has convenient types that sometimes allow for inferring more specific types of values - even if it's not completely type-safe.

If all you need to do is loop over the key-value pairs of an object `Object.entries` is a convenient way to do so.

## Option: Rethinking What You're Doing

TypeScript's type checker is often right to complain that loops over object keys can easily include unexpected values.
