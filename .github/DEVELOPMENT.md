# Development

TODO

Will mention:

- only one package.json
- CI tasks as they're created

## Local Development

```shell
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Updating Git Submodules

```shell
git submodule foreach git pull
```
